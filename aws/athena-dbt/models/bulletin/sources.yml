          Hand-copied values from all of the COVID-19 cases (confirmed, probable
          and suspect) and deaths that we have collected from the daily PDF that
          the Puerto Rico Department of Health published from April 2020 until
          July 2021.

        columns:
          - name: bulletin_date
            description: >
              The date of the PDF bulletin that this datum was taken from.  This
              follows the convention that it's the "data up to" date, i.e., that
              the counts in each row only reflect data received by the last second
              of that date.  These bulletins were normally finished by the end of
              the bulletin day, but published the next day, so many third-party
              data collections look a day late compared to this field.

          - name: datum_date
            description: >
              The date that the events that this row counts actually happened.
              For cases, this is the test sample date, and for deaths it is the
              date that the death happened.
